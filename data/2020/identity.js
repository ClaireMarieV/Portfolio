  text: `I converted one of my sketches to a vector with Adobe Illustrator.
        I was looking for elegance but didn't want a black and white logo.
      The logo takes the overall shape of a diamond, further reinforced by
      the presence of an actual diamond at the top.
      The leaves are slightly bent to contrast with the sharpness of their angles.
      Although there has been a trend for thick strokes in 2021,
      the lines are thin and the asymmetry of the background color
      brings smoothness and modernity.`,
